There is no definitive answer to this question as it can depend on individual circumstances. It is possible that a murderous hag may be able to teach if she is able to find students who are willing to learn from her, although it is also possible that she may not be able to find any students willing to learn from her.  

There's a lot of debate surrounding the teaching of Hagrid, the gamekeeper-turned-teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Some say that his methods are unorthodox and that he's too lenient with students. Others believe that he's the perfect person to teach young witches and wizards, as he has a wealth of experience and knowledge.

However, there are some who believe that Hagrid should never have been allowed to teach, as he was once convicted of killing another wizard. This argument usually comes down to the fact that Hagrid is half-giant, and therefore has a different understanding of morality.

 Personally, I believe that Hagrid is a great teacher, and that his past should not be held against him. He's made mistakes, but he's also learned from them. I think that the students at Hogwarts would benefit greatly from his teaching.
